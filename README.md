# snake-game
A console-based snake game created using C++.

## Description

This is a simple snake game implemented in C++. The snake moves around the console, eats food to grow longer, and the game speeds up as the snake eats more food. Unlike the old snake game that we all are familiar with, in this game when the snake hits it self nothing happens! instead the game come to over when the snake hits the wall!
so you better watch out!

also i should tell you that we have a text file called high.txt which is used to save the highscores.

## How to Play
- at first, press any key to start the game.
- Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to move the snake up, left, down, and right respectively.
- The snake will grow longer each time it eats the food.
- The game ends if the snake hits the wall.
